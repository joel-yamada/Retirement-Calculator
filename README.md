## Description:
This a retirement calculator based on input parameters that can help you plan for retirement. There are default parameters and also an option to show when the target amount for retirement will be reached.

I also included a composition of contributions versus investment growth. With an average rate of return of around 7-8%, it is evident that over time, much of the balance will end up being comprised of investments growing as opposed to contributions being put in. This is even more evident with higher number of compounding periods to accrue interest.
